# Real Time Collaboration Platform

## Overview / Description
The Real-Time Collaboration Platform is a web-based application that enables multiple users to collaboratively edit documents in real time, similar to tools like Notion or Google Docs. The platform supports live text synchronization, user presence indicators, version tracking, and access permissions.

This tool is ideal for teams, organizations, and developers building collaborative apps that require low-latency data sharing and intuitive UI/UX for simultaneous user interactions.

## Features

- Clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS and React
- Secure backend with role-based access policies

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React app managing the UI and WebSocket communication
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express server handling socket connections, auth, and data persistence
- **Realtime Engine:** WebSocket server powered by `socket.io`, coordinating collaboration
- **Data Sync:** CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) ensures consistent document state across users
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user accounts, documents, and version history

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Zustand (state), Socket.IO Client
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO Server, MongoDB
